\section*{Extending the theoretical results}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the effect of adaptive resampling?
\item Corollaries also for residual-multinomial and stratified resampling.
\item Rates of convergence (modifying more of M\"ohle's work).
\item Could badly-behaved potentials produce a non-Kingman Lambda-coalescent? For example, use for potentials some heavy-tailed fitnesses like in Schweinsberg model. This is probably not interesting from an SMC point of view.
\item A way to estimate coalescent rates a priori for some specific tractable class of models, say.
\item Do our results apply to cloning models, or other continuous-time models?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Resampling}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare residual-stratified vs. stratified resampling (and residual-systematic vs systematic): are they equivalent? What if the weights are sorted? Maybe start by coding up an exploratory experiment.
\item Compare theoretical computation/storage costs and parallelisability between the different resampling schemes.
\item Is there a nice set of weights that will nicely illustrate all the points I want to make about resampling schemes?
\item Can the comparison of time-scales for different schemes be wrangled into/ related to a direct comparison of the variances? Is this even useful?
\item Don't forget the resampling scheme that's even worse than multinomial: sampling once from Categorical and replicating it N times. This leads to a star-shaped coalescent, which sets a precedent for non-Kingman Lambda coalescents from SMC genealogies.
\item (See marked notebook 3 page circa Jun/Jul 2020 for some more thoughts/ideas.)
\item (Just for fun:) in stochastic rounding, how many possible ways are there to assign the offspring counts? Consider that each of the N counts takes one of two possible values, but this will overcount a lot because we are also constrained by offspring counts summing to N.
\item (Conjecture:) pre-sorting of weights reduces resampling variance, but increases the coalescence rate. Intuition: when weights are sorted, small weights that sum to less than 1/N are grouped together so only one of them can have a child. (It may be that this effect is entirely cancelled by the reduction in variance elsewhere.)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Simulation experiments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Now we (almost?) have weak convergence, redo similar experiments to those at end of KJJS, but without having to fudge the argument in order to apply FDD convergence.
\item Code up all the different sampling schemes (and sorted/unsorted variants etc.) and come up with some useful (if only illustrative) experiments comparing them.
\item Decide which functions would be most interesting to illustrate the performance of resampling schemes, say using ternary diagrams. (See marked notebook 3 page at 8/7/20.)
\item Explore pre-asymptotic behaviour of CSMC for example. I did some work on this previously.
\item Make edits to my ternary plot ``library'' (see notebook 3 marked page at 8/7/20).
\end{itemize}
