\chapter{Abstract} %%% remove the "Abstract" title?

%%% The abstract must be no more than 300 words and may be single-spaced to ensure it fits on one page.

%%% A list of acronyms must be placed either here or at the end of the thesis, and its location indicated in the ToC.


\mainmatter

%%% The main body will be contained in separate tex files for each chapter, which are pulled in using these commands:

\include{introduction}
\include{background}
%\include{limits}
%\include{csmc}
%\include{weakconv}
%\include{discussion}


\backmatter

%%% A list of acronyms must be placed either here or after the abstract, and its location indicated in the ToC.
