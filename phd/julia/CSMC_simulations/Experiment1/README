# ----- Experiment 1 -----
#
# This experiment involves plotting tree heights of conditionalSMC genealogies,
# as the "plausibility" of the immortal line varies.
#
# It does not attempt to disentangle the effects of tree structure
# from likelihood of sampling the immortal particle among the n sampled leaves
