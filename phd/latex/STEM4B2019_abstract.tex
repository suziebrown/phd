\maketitle

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) encompasses a wide range of particle-based sampling methods employed across the sciences. Originally conceived for the simulation of molecular systems in physics, SMC is now used to forecast weather, track military targets, interpret medical test results and much more.
Its application domains range from purely scientific endeavours such as inferring the genetic evolution of a species or understanding the transitions between states of matter; to personal issues such as ?? or the early detection of neurological diseases from brain scans; to matters of national security such as understanding the progression from a dissatisfied individual to a potential terrorist, or predicting a financial crisis.
