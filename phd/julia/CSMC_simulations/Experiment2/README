# ----- Experiment 2 -----
#
# This experiment builds on experiment 1 by somewhat isolating
# the effects of the tree structure from the effects of randomly
# sampling or not sampling the immortal particle among the leaves.
#
# For each series, there are two versions: one where the sample of
# leaves does not include the immortal particle, and one where it
# does. These are compared using the same conditionalSMC runs, but
# with different leaf samples and hence different sub-genealogies.
