\subsection*{\cite{kingman1982gene}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduces the $n$-coalescent (in a very nice clear way) with the sam enotation we still use
\item \textbf{Theorem:} suppose $\nu_{1:N}$ are exchangeable and independent across generations and $\V[\nu_1]\to\sigma^2 \in (0,\infty)$ and $\E[\nu_1^m] \leq M_m$ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$. Then the $n$-genealogies scaled by $\lfloor N\sigma^{-2}t \rfloor$ converge to the $n$-coalescent in the sense of FDDs.
\item $n$-coalescent also applies for models where $\nu_j$ are not exchangeable or independent across generations, as long as the genealogies are Markov at least up to error $O(N^{-1})$ and the transitions satisfy $p_{\xi\eta} = q_{\xi\eta}\sigma^2 N^{-1} + o(N^{-1})$, where $q$'s are transition probs of $n$-coalescent
\item The $n$-coalescent is a good robust model for \emph{large neutral} populations
\item Genealogy decouples into a jump chain and a pure death process
\item There exists the Kingman coalescent as infinite-dimensional embedding of the $n$-coalescents
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\cite{kingman1982coal}}
Broadly, this paper introduces the Kingman coalescent (as opposed to $n$-coalescent) and proves some properties


\subsection*{\cite{mohle1998}}
Necessary \& sufficient conditions for convergence of Cannings model to a coalescent process more general than Kingman. Allowing large mergers but not simultaneous mergers.
\begin{itemize}
\item Population size can vary over time, but only deterministically
\item Offspring counts must be independent but not necessarily identically distributed across generations
\item This means time scale must be allowed to vary over time: $\tau_N$ becomes $\tau_N(t)$ and $c_N$ becomes $c_N(t)$, or $c(t)$ in M\"ohle's notation
\item Only proves convergence of FDDs
\item Conditions of theorem are still very strong, requiring infinitely many moments to be bounded. There is now a condition on one mixed moment that wasn't needed in Kingman1982.
\item The conditions are sufficient but not necessary
\item Time scale $\tau_N(t)$ is allowed to be chosen freely, but the theorem only holds when it is an appropriate function (i.e.\ an inverse of $c_N$ similar to the usual) so this is not a very great generalisation over defining $\tau$ in the usual way.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\cite{mohlesagitov1998}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume $\nu_{1:N}$ are exchangeable, and i.i.d. across generations, and the population size $N$ is constant
\item Necessary \& sufficient conditions are given for (FDD) convergence of the genealogies to a $\Lambda$-coalescent, and the correct measure $\Lambda$ is uniquely constructed from infinitely many moment limits. (Note: M\"ohle's notation uses $\mu$ for the measure rather than $\Lambda$.)
\item The conditions are: (I) infinitely many pure moment limits exist, slightly different from the condition 2a of M\"ohle1998; (II) the exchangeable version of the mixed moment condition 2b of M\"ohle1998.
\item Under the additional condition $c_N\to0$ we also get weak convergence to the $\Lambda$-coalescent, although the proof is not explicit in this paper (it just refers to the methods of another work).
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\cite{sagitov1999}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume $\nu_{1:N}$ are exchangeable, and i.i.d. across generations, and the population size $N$ is constant
\item $k$-mergers (but not simultaneous mergers) are allowed
\item 3 necessary conditions are given for FDD convergence to some limit of the form $p_{\xi\eta} = \delta_{\xi\eta} + V_N q_{\xi\eta} + o(V_N)$, where $Q=(q_{\xi\eta})$ is some Markov generator, and $V_N \to 0$.
\item Additionally, a subset of the necessary conditions are shown to be sufficient for the above asymptotic relation to hold with specific $Q$ corresponding to a $\Lambda$-coalescent, on the (constant, deterministic) time scale $T_N^{-1} \sim V_N$.
\item Unfortunately I didn't really understand the second and third conditions...
\item As one would expect, the necessary conditions can be shown to hold when Kingman's condition $\sup_N \E[\nu_1^k]<\infty \forall k\geq 2$ applies (see Remark 1)
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\cite{mohle1999}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Population size can vary over time, but only deterministically
\item Offspring counts must be independent but not necessarily identically distributed across generations --- this ensures the genealogical process is Markovian, but not time-homogeneous
\item Individuals are not necessarily exchangeable, but our standing assumption (here called the ``random assignment condition'') is assumed
\item Time scale $\tau_N(t)$ is allowed to be chosen freely, but the theorem only holds when it is an appropriate function (i.e.\ an inverse of $c_N$ similar to the usual) so this is not a very great generalisation over defining $\tau$ in the usual way.
\item Theorem conditions are exactly the same as in M\"ohle1998
\item Convergence is now proved additionally in the weak sense, as opposed to just FDDs
\item Proof technique is overall the one I used for weak convergence of SMC genealogies, except M\"ohle's doesn't have the external expectations. These expectations appear in my proof because the coupled process can only be defined conditionally on $\mathcal{F}_\infty$, because the generations are not independent
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\cite{mohle2000}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed population size $N$
\item Offspring counts are exchangeable and i.i.d. across generations
\item Treats full characterisation of possible limiting coalescents (I think the class is known as $\Xi$-coalescents), where there are possibly simultaneous and/or multiple mergers. The particular limiting coalescent can be characterised by (mixed) factorial moments, here denoted $\Phi_a(b_1,\dots,b_a)$. These quantities are central to the analysis, and results are given in terms of them, so can be applied to any exchangeable model.
\item It is shown that the Kingman coalescent appears as the limit if and only if $ \lim \frac{\E[(\nu_1)_3]}{N\E[(\nu_1)_2]} =0$. (See equation (14) or (16).) This is the exchangeable version of the main theorem condition I use in my SMC genealogies work. I think this work is the earliest use of this simplified condition.
\item Total variation bounds are proved in the general case, left in terms of the particular transition probabilities of the model (see Thm 1).
\item More specific bounds are calculated for the case where the model is in the domain of attraction of Kingman's coalescent (i.e. second moments dominate third moments, as above / in equation (14)). The bounds have a simple form and are left in terms of $c_N$ and some $\Phi$ functions which correspond to $\E[(\nu_1)_3]$ and $\E[(\nu_1)_2(\nu_2)_2]$, which could easily be computed for a given model. It is clear that under the conditions of convergence to KC, the given TV bound converges to zero, as expected.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{\cite{mohle2001}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Constant population size $N$
\item Offspring counts are exchangeable within generations and i.i.d. between generations --- implies the genealogical process is a time-homogeneous Markov chain
\item Treats full variety of possible limits for exchangeable models (again, I think the family is $\Xi$-coalescents)
\item Presents necessary and sufficient conditions for weak convergence to an appropriate $\Xi$-coalescent, and the particular $\Xi$ is uniquely determined by moments of the offspring distribution
\item A proof of FDD convergence is given. When $c_N\to c\neq0$ the limiting process is discrete and weak convergence follows immediately from FDDs. When $c_N\to0$ the limit is continuous and tightness is needed for weak comvergence; the proof is not presented, just a reference to M\"ohle1999.
\item Since the conditions given are necessary and sufficient, and can be applied to any exchangeable (Cannings-type) model, this constitutes a complete characterisation of the limiting genealogies for this class of models.
\item Section 6 gives a cute bit of history of coalescent theory
\end{itemize}
