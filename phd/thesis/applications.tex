\section{Multinomial resampling}
This is the easy-to-analyse scheme, because conditionally i.i.d., and was presented in KJJS already. Now (with our simpler conditions) it is easier to show.

\subsection{Proof of finite time scale condition}


\section{Stochastic rounding}

\subsection{Proof of main condition}

\subsection{Proof of finite time scale condition}


\section{The worst possible resampling scheme}
Remark that this one doesn't converge to KC, but rather to a star-shaped coalescent.


\section{Conditional SMC}
Why CSMC is qualitatively different to, say, standard SMC with multinomial resampling (immortal particle etc.). Reasons for restriction to multinomial resampling, conjecture that limit theorem holds for other schemes in CSMC.

\subsection{Proof of main condition}

\subsection{Proof of finite time scale condition}

\subsection{Effect of ancestor sampling}
Argue that ancestor sampling removes bias towards assigning offspring to immortal line, and leaves exactly the same genealogy as standard SMC with multinomial resampling.
